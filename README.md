# Stock-program

The goal of the project is to create a program that allows investors to create customizable portfolios based on the maximum sharpe ratio and getting the financial data.
Therefore, the program is divided in two sections:

-The first section allows users to input stock tickers in order to construct an optimized portfolio based on the maximum sharp ratio and the respective weights of each stock.

-The secound part allows for users to download in csv data the balance sheet statement, cash flow statement, earnings, recommendations, dividends, sustainability and next events for each of the selected stocks.
